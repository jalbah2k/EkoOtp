        <member name="P:skmMenu.RoleCollection.Roles">
            <summary>
            Returns the list of roles as a string array.
            </summary>
            <remarks>The RoleCollection class only contains methods to add, remove, and check to see if a role exists in
            the collection.  It does not provide a means to enumerate through the roles.  In order to enumerate through
            the roles, use this property to retrieve the roles as a string array.</remarks>

        <member name="P:skmMenu.RoleCollection.System#Web#UI#IStateManager#IsTrackingViewState">
            <summary>

            implements the IStateManager interface.
